title: Self-Update Command
body: The CLI provides a 'lattice update' command that downloads and replaces the running binary with the latest release from GitHub. Fetches release metadata from GitHub API, downloads the platform-appropriate tar.gz archive and checksums.txt, verifies SHA-256 checksum, extracts the binary, and atomically replaces the running executable via self-replace. Supports --check (check-only), --force (downgrade/reinstall), --version (specific version), and --format text|json. Warns when running from a development build (target/debug or target/release paths). Reports rate limiting clearly.
