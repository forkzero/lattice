title: Passive Update Notification on Launch
body: 'On every CLI command launch, after command output completes, the CLI checks whether a newer version is available and prints a dimmed one-line notice to stderr. Uses a 24-hour file cache (~/.lattice/update-check.json) to avoid hitting GitHub API on every invocation. Network check uses a 5-second timeout. Silently skips when: the command is ''update'' or ''mcp'', stderr is not a TTY (piped output), running from a development build, or HOME is unset. On network failure, writes the current timestamp to suppress retries for 24 hours.'
