title: Sync Command for Push/Pull to Remote
body: The CLI provides 'lattice sync push' and 'lattice sync pull' commands to synchronize the local .lattice/ directory with a remote backend. Push uploads local state to remote. Pull downloads remote state to local. Sync is explicit, not automatic — user controls when synchronization happens. Requires authentication via API key or OAuth token configured in .lattice/config.yaml or environment variable.
