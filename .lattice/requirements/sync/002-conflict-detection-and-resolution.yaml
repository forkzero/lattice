title: Conflict Detection and Resolution
body: 'When syncing, lattice detects conflicts where both local and remote have modified the same node since last sync. Conflicts are reported with both versions shown. Resolution options: --force-local (overwrite remote), --force-remote (overwrite local), or manual merge. Node versioning (semver) enables conflict detection by comparing version numbers and timestamps.'
