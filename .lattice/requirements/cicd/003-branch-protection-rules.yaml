title: Branch Protection Rules
body: 'The main branch must be protected with rules that enforce quality gates. Required settings: (1) require status checks to pass before merge, (2) require CI workflow to complete successfully, (3) require branch to be up-to-date before merge. This ensures no code reaches main without passing automated validation. Configuration is stored in repository settings and documented in CONTRIBUTING.md.'
