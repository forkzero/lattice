title: Automated CI on Pull Requests and Pushes
body: 'All pull requests and pushes to main trigger automated CI. The CI pipeline runs: (1) code formatting check (cargo fmt), (2) linting (cargo clippy), (3) all tests (cargo test), (4) release build (cargo build --release), (5) CLI smoke tests against the repository''s own .lattice/ directory. PRs cannot merge if CI fails. CI results are visible in GitHub Actions.'
