title: Proposal Modes for Agent Changes
body: "Agent-proposed changes to the lattice support three modes: (1) interactive - changes require human review in terminal before applying, (2) batch - changes are written to a file or branch for PR-based review, (3) trust - changes are applied directly (for trusted automation). The mode is configured per-session or per-request. Default is interactive to prevent unreviewed modifications."
