title: Vector Similarity Search
body: Optional vector-based semantic search for large lattices (500+ nodes). Uses local embedding model (no API keys) with content-hash caching to avoid regenerating unchanged embeddings. Deferred until structured search proves insufficient. Implementation should use language-portable solutions (ONNX Runtime, LanceDB) to support potential Rust rewrite.
