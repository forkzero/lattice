title: JSON-RPC Protocol over Socket
body: "The Lattice server exposes a JSON-RPC 2.0 API over Unix domain socket for LLM integration. This design avoids API keys by leveraging the hosting agent's LLM. The protocol supports: node CRUD operations, graph queries, drift detection, and proposal workflows. Requests include method, params, and optional id. Responses include result or error with code/message."
