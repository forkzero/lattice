title: JSON-RPC Protocol via MCP
body: |
  MCP (Model Context Protocol) uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio as its transport layer.
  By implementing REQ-API-004 (MCP Server Mode), we get JSON-RPC "for free" without
  building a custom protocol layer. The MCP SDK handles request/response framing,
  method dispatch, and error handling per JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.

  This requirement is satisfied by the MCP implementation rather than a separate
  JSON-RPC server. Unix domain socket and HTTP transports are deferred to future
  SaaS requirements (REQ-API-009).
