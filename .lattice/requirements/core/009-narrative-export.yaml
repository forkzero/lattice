title: Export Narrative View for Target Audience
body: |
  The lattice can be exported as a narrative document tailored to a
  specific audience (investor, contributor, customer, team member).

  The export:
  - Renders theses with their supporting sources
  - Groups requirements by priority and category
  - Shows implementation coverage/progress
  - Follows a configurable narrative template
  - Respects visibility flags (public/internal nodes)

  Supported audiences (initial):
  - `investor`: Strategic focus, thesis-first, market opportunity framing
  - `contributor`: Technical focus, requirements-first, how to help
  - `overview`: Balanced, suitable for README or documentation

acceptance:
- id: AT-001
  given: a lattice with theses, sources, requirements, implementations
  when: '`lattice export --format narrative --audience investor` is run'
  then: a markdown document is generated with thesis→evidence→requirements→progress flow
  verification: automated
- id: AT-002
  given: 'nodes with `visibility: internal`'
  when: export runs with default settings
  then: internal nodes are excluded from output
  verification: automated
- id: AT-003
  given: a lattice with implementations linked to requirements
  when: export runs
  then: progress section shows coverage (X of Y requirements implemented)
  verification: automated
- id: AT-004
  given: '`lattice export --format narrative --audience contributor`'
  when: run
  then: output emphasizes requirements, how to contribute, and open issues

  derives_from:
  - target: THX-PROSE-PRIMARY
    version: 1.0.0
    rationale: Narrative export preserves prose-first principle for human readers
  - target: THX-AGENT-NATIVE-TOOLS
    version: 1.0.0
    rationale: Structured lattice enables automated document generation
  extends:
  - target: REQ-CORE-008
    rationale: Narrative export is a specialized form of markdown export
