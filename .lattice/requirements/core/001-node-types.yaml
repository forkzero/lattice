title: Four Primary Node Types
body: |
  The lattice supports four primary node types that form the knowledge hierarchy:

  1. **Source**: Primary research artifacts (papers, articles, data, URLs)
  2. **Thesis**: Strategic claims derived from research
  3. **Requirement**: Testable specifications derived from theses
  4. **Implementation**: Code/config that satisfies requirements

  Each node type has specific metadata schemas while sharing common fields
  (id, title, body, version, status, created_at, created_by).

acceptance:
- id: AT-001
  given: a YAML file in .lattice/sources/
  when: parsed by the lattice
  then: it is recognized as a Source node with source-specific metadata
  verification: automated
- id: AT-002
  given: node types Source, Thesis, Requirement, Implementation
  when: a node is created
  then: it must specify one of these types AND type-specific metadata is validated
  verification: automated
- id: AT-003
  given: any node
  when: retrieved via API or CLI
  then: it has id, type, title, body, version, status, created_at, created_by fields
