type: requirement

title: "Human-Readable Title and Body on All Nodes"
body: |
  Every node must have:
  - `title`: A concise, human-readable name (< 100 characters)
  - `body`: A prose description in markdown format

  The body is the primary content. Structured metadata (edges, acceptance
  tests, etc.) augments the prose but doesn't replace it.

  A human should be able to understand a requirement by reading only its
  title and body, without parsing the metadata.
