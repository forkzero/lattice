title: File Naming Convention for Nodes
body: 'Node files follow a consistent naming convention: (1) Requirements: {category}/{id_number}-{slug}.yaml where slug is derived from title (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens, max 40 chars), (2) Theses: {slug}.yaml where slug is ID without THX- prefix, (3) Sources: {slug}.yaml where slug is ID without SRC- prefix, (4) Implementations: {slug}.yaml where slug is ID without IMP- prefix. The lattice CLI enforces this convention when adding nodes. Existing files with different naming are accepted but new files follow the convention.'
