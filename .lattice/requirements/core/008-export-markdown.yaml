title: Export Lattice to Markdown Views
body: |
  The lattice can be exported to human-readable markdown files:

  ```bash
  # Export all requirements
  $ lattice export requirements --format markdown > docs/REQUIREMENTS.md

  # Export traceability matrix
  $ lattice export matrix > docs/TRACEABILITY.md

  # Export theses with supporting sources
  $ lattice export theses --with-sources > docs/STRATEGIC_THESES.md

  # Export sources as bibliography
  $ lattice export sources --format bibtex > docs/references.bib
  ```

  Generated files include a header:
  ```markdown
  <!-- AUTO-GENERATED FROM LATTICE - DO NOT EDIT -->
  <!-- Source: .lattice/requirements/**/*.yaml -->
  <!-- Generated: 2026-02-03T12:00:00Z -->
  ```

  The lattice is the source of truth; markdown is a view.
