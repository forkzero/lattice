title: Semantic Versioning for All Nodes
body: |
  All nodes use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

  - **MAJOR**: Breaking change to meaning or interface
    - Requirement: Fundamental change to what's required
    - Thesis: Core claim changed
    - Implementation: API breaking change

  - **MINOR**: Backward-compatible addition or clarification
    - Requirement: Added acceptance test, clarified language
    - Thesis: Added supporting evidence
    - Implementation: New feature, same interface

  - **PATCH**: Bug fix or typo correction
    - Any node: Typo fix, formatting, no semantic change

  Version increments are explicit (not automatic). The author decides
  whether a change is major/minor/patch based on impact.

- id: AT-001
  given: any node
  when: created
  then: it has a version field in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
  verification: automated
- id: AT-002
  given: a node is updated
  when: saved
  then: the version must be greater than the previous version
  verification: automated
- id: AT-003
  given: version change from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
  when: drift analysis runs
  then: it is classified as a major change
