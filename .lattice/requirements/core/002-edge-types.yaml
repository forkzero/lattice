title: Typed, Directed Edges with Semantics
body: |
  Edges connect nodes with explicit types that convey semantic meaning:

  **Justification edges** (downward flow):
  - `supports`: Source → Thesis (research backs claim)
  - `derives`: Thesis → Requirement (spec follows from strategy)
  - `satisfies`: Implementation → Requirement (code implements spec)

  **Dependency edges** (lateral):
  - `depends_on`: Requirement → Requirement (prerequisite)
  - `extends`: Requirement → Requirement (refinement)

  **Feedback edges** (upward flow):
  - `reveals_gap_in`: Implementation → Requirement/Thesis (found missing pieces)
  - `challenges`: Any → Thesis (evidence contradicts)
  - `validates`: Implementation → Thesis (evidence confirms)

  **Conflict edges**:
  - `conflicts_with`: Any → Any (cannot both be true)
  - `supersedes`: Any → Any (this replaces that)

  Each edge type has constraints on valid source/target node types.
