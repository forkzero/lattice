title: Skill Version Drift Tracking
body: "When the lattice references external skills (via recommendation edges or skill-reference nodes), it should track the version of the skill at the time of reference. When a skill is updated in its source registry, 'lattice drift' should surface it alongside node-level drift — the same version-bound edge mechanism that detects stale theses detects stale skill references. This keeps the project's capability awareness current: if a better version of a code-review skill exists, or if a research skill's methodology has changed, the product owner is prompted to re-evaluate. Implementation should store skill references as source-type nodes with registry metadata (registry URL, package identifier, version, last-checked timestamp) so they participate in standard drift detection without special-casing."
