title: Skill Recommendation from Graph Analysis
body: "The product owner agent should analyze the lattice graph to recommend external skills or agents that could help evaluate theses or implement requirements. Given a thesis in status 'active' with low confidence, the agent should suggest analytical or research skills that could stress-test the claim. Given a requirement in status 'active' with no satisfying implementation, the agent should suggest implementation skills matching the tech stack and domain. Recommendations are recorded as edges (e.g. 'recommends_skill') pointing to a lightweight skill-reference node, so the reasoning is persistent and auditable. The recommendation logic should be registry-agnostic — it reasons about capability needs from the graph structure and matches against whatever skill catalogs are configured as sources. Initial implementation can use the product owner's own reasoning over skill descriptions; later iterations may use structured search APIs."
