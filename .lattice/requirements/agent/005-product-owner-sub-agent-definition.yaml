title: Product Owner Sub-Agent Definition
body: 'A dedicated sub-agent acts as product owner, with its own system prompt, tool access (lattice MCP tools + read-only file access), and enforced workflow. It runs in a separate context window from the coding agent, owns strategic reasoning, and writes decisions back to the lattice as nodes and edges. It must be composable — invocable from Claude Code, CI pipelines, chat interfaces, or cron jobs. The agent definition lives in .claude/agents/product-owner.md and specifies: (1) system prompt with PO responsibilities, (2) available tools (lattice MCP), (3) workflow enforcement (search, propose, challenge, finalize), (4) structured output format for returning recommendations to the parent context.'
