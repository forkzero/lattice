title: Product Owner Action Protocol
body: 'The product owner agent supports five core actions: (1) triage — read feedback edges, drift reports, unresolved requirements and output prioritized backlog with rationale, (2) critique — challenge existing theses against implementation evidence and create challenges edges where theses no longer hold, (3) plan — propose next wave of work as structured PlannedItems written back to lattice, (4) review — evaluate whether an implementation satisfies linked requirements and record validates or reveals_gap_in edges with evidence, (5) align — check that all active requirements trace to active theses and all theses trace to sources and flag orphans. Each action operates in the configured proposal mode (interactive/batch/trust) per REQ-API-005.'
