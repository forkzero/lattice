title: Product Owner Packaged as Distributable Skill
body: "The lattice product owner agent should be packageable as a distributable skill that can be listed on skill registries (e.g. Tessl) and installed into any project with a single command. The skill package must include: (1) the agent definition (system prompt, workflow, tool access), (2) the lattice CLI as a declared dependency, (3) installation logic that runs 'lattice init' if no .lattice/ directory exists, (4) metadata describing the skill's purpose, supported platforms, and version. The package format should follow the SKILL.md convention for broad compatibility while including lattice-specific configuration. This enables adoption without requiring users to understand the full lattice architecture upfront — they install a 'product owner skill' and it bootstraps the lattice underneath."
