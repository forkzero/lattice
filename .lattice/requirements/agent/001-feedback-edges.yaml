title: Agents Can Record Feedback via Edges
body: |
  Agents should be able to record what they learn during implementation:

  **Gap discovery:**
  ```yaml
  edge:
    type: reveals_gap_in
    from: IMP-MY-IMPL
    to: REQ-FOO-001
    rationale: "Requirement doesn't specify timeout behavior"
  ```

  **Challenge to thesis:**
  ```yaml
  edge:
    type: challenges
    from: IMP-MY-IMPL
    to: THX-SOME-CLAIM
    rationale: "Implementation shows this assumption is incorrect"
  ```

  **Validation of thesis:**
  ```yaml
  edge:
    type: validates
    from: IMP-MY-IMPL
    to: THX-SOME-CLAIM
    rationale: "Implementation confirms the thesis holds in practice"
  ```

  These feedback edges enable knowledge to flow upstream, not just down.

acceptance:
- id: AT-001
  given: an agent creates a `reveals_gap_in` edge
  when: the lattice is queried
  then: the gap is visible and linked to the implementation that found it
  verification: automated
- id: AT-002
  given: multiple `challenges` edges to a thesis
  when: thesis is queried
  then: all challenges are listed with their rationale
  verification: automated
- id: AT-003
  given: feedback edge from implementation to thesis
  when: '`lattice graph THX-* --direction downstream` runs'
  then: the implementation's feedback edge is included
