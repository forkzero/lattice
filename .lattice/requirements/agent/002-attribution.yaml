title: Clear Attribution for Agent vs Human Actions
body: |
  Every node and edge records who created it:

  ```yaml
  created_by: "human:george"      # Human author
  created_by: "agent:claude-opus" # AI agent
  created_by: "ci:github-actions" # Automated system
  ```

  This enables:
  - Audit trails showing agent vs human contributions
  - Filtering by author type
  - Understanding provenance of knowledge

  The `created_by` field is required and cannot be modified after creation.
