title: Clear Attribution for Agent vs Human Actions
body: |
  Every node and edge records who created it and who requested it:

  ```yaml
  created_by: "agent:claude-2026-02-04"           # Who performed the action
  requested_by: "George Moon <george@email.com>" # Who initiated the action
  ```

  The `created_by` field indicates the actor (human, agent, or CI system):
  - `human:george` - Human author
  - `agent:claude-2026-02-04` - AI agent with date
  - `ci:github-actions` - Automated system

  The `requested_by` field captures the human who initiated agent actions,
  auto-populated from git config (user.name and user.email).

  This enables:
  - Audit trails showing agent vs human contributions
  - Tracking who requested agent-created content
  - Filtering by author type
  - Understanding provenance of knowledge

  Both fields are set at creation and cannot be modified.
