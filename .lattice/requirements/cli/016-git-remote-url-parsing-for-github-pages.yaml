title: Git Remote URL Parsing for GitHub Pages
body: The CLI shall parse git remote origin URLs to derive GitHub Pages base URLs. Both HTTPS (https://github.com/owner/repo.git) and SSH (git@github.com:owner/repo.git) formats shall be supported. The derived URL follows the pattern https://{owner}.github.io/{repo}. If the remote is not a GitHub URL or no origin is configured, the command shall fail with a clear error message.
