title: Summary Command for Compact Lattice Status
body: 'The CLI provides a ''lattice summary'' command that outputs a compact status overview: node counts by type, requirements by resolution status and priority, drift status, orphaned requirements (no derives_from), and orphaned theses (no requirements derive from them). Supports --format json for structured output. Designed for agent workflows where token efficiency matters.'
