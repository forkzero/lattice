title: Edit command for modifying existing nodes
body: 'The CLI should provide an ''edit'' command that allows modifying mutable fields of existing nodes: title, body, status, priority, tags, and category. Syntax: lattice edit <ID> [--title ...] [--body ...] [--status ...] [--priority ...] [--tags ...] [--category ...]. Only specified fields are updated; others remain unchanged. The node version is auto-bumped (patch increment) on any change, which triggers drift detection on version-bound edges. The command should reject edits to immutable fields (id, type, created_at, created_by). Supports --format text|json output.'
