title: GitHub Pages Export Format
body: 'The CLI shall support ''lattice export --format pages --output <dir>'' which generates a complete GitHub Pages deployment in a single command. The output directory shall contain: (1) lattice-data.json with the full node index wrapped in project metadata (project name, description, generated_at timestamp), and (2) an index.html that redirects to the hosted reader at forkzero.ai/reader with the derived GitHub Pages JSON URL as a query parameter. The GitHub Pages URL shall be derived automatically from the git remote origin URL (supports both HTTPS and SSH formats). This replaces manual boilerplate in CI workflows with a single atomic step.'
