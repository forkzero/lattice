title: Resolve Command with Status Tracking
body: 'The CLI must support a ''lattice resolve'' command to track requirement resolution status. States: (1) --verified: requirement is satisfied and working, (2) --blocked ''reason'': external constraint prevents implementation, implies revisit when context changes, (3) --deferred ''reason'': user chose to postpone, implies revisit later, (4) --wontfix ''reason'': will not implement, no revisit. The command updates the requirement''s resolution status and records the reason. Use ''lattice list --pending'' to show all blocked and deferred items awaiting revisit.'
