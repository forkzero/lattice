title: Check Drift via CLI
body: |
  The `lattice drift` command detects version and content drift:

  ```bash
  # Show all drift
  $ lattice drift

  # Check specific scope
  $ lattice drift --scope implementations
  $ lattice drift --scope requirements

  # CI mode: exit non-zero if drift detected
  $ lattice drift --check

  # Show only errors (major version changes)
  $ lattice drift --severity error
  ```

  Output shows:
  - Node ID
  - Bound version vs current version
  - Severity (patch/minor/major)
  - Affected downstream nodes

acceptance:
- id: AT-001
  given: an implementation bound to requirement v1.0.0
  when: requirement is updated to v1.1.0 and `lattice drift` runs
  then: drift is reported with severity 'minor'
  verification: automated
- id: AT-002
  given: '`lattice drift --check` with drift present'
  when: executed
  then: exit code is non-zero
  verification: automated
- id: AT-003
  given: '`lattice drift --check` with no drift'
  when: executed
  then: exit code is zero
  verification: automated
