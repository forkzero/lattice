title: "Files in Git Should Be Source of Truth, Not a Database"
body: |
  Requirements management tools typically use databases as the source of
  truth, with files as exports. This creates problems:

  Database as source:
  - Requires running infrastructure
  - History is tool-specific (not git-native)
  - Offline access limited
  - Vendor lock-in
  - Branching/merging is complicated

  Files as source (with API as view):
  - Git provides versioning, history, blame for free
  - Works offline
  - Diffable in PRs ("this PR changes requirement X")
  - No database to manage
  - Portable across projects
  - Standard tooling (grep, sed, any editor)

  The API server should read/write files, not maintain separate state.
  This makes the lattice a "view" over the filesystem, not a separate
  database that must be synchronized.

  Trade-off: Some queries are slower than a database. But for requirement
  volumes (hundreds to low thousands), file-based is fast enough.
