title: Knowledge Flows Bidirectionally Between Layers
body: |
  The traditional view of requirements is top-down:
    Strategy → Requirements → Implementation

  But in practice, information flows both ways:
    - Implementation reveals gaps in requirements
    - Requirements challenge assumptions in strategy
    - New research invalidates existing theses

  A knowledge system must support this bidirectional flow:

  Downward (justification):
    - Research SUPPORTS theses
    - Theses DERIVE requirements
    - Requirements are SATISFIED BY implementations

  Upward (feedback):
    - Implementations REVEAL GAPS IN requirements
    - Implementations CHALLENGE or VALIDATE theses
    - Theses create NEED FOR RESEARCH

  Ignoring upward flow means losing knowledge gained during implementation.
  The system should make it easy to record feedback, not just consume specs.
