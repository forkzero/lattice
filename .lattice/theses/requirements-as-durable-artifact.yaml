title: Requirements Become the Most Durable Artifact in Agent-Built Systems
body: |
  As AI agents become capable of generating and regenerating code from
  specifications, the relative durability of artifacts inverts:

  Traditional hierarchy (most to least durable):
  1. Code (years of accumulated work)
  2. Documentation (updated occasionally)
  3. Requirements (often outdated)
  4. Strategy (in people's heads)

  Agent-era hierarchy (most to least durable):
  1. Strategic intent (why we're building this)
  2. Requirements (what it should do)
  3. Code (can be regenerated from requirements)

  This inversion means:
  - Requirements become the primary artifact worth maintaining
  - Code becomes more disposable (cheaper to regenerate than maintain)
  - Investment should shift from code quality to requirements quality

  Implication: We need better tools for requirements, not just better tools for code.

    rationale: Agents can generate code from specs, making code less precious
  - target: SRC-REQUIREMENTS-DRIFT
    version: 1.0.0
    rationale: If requirements drift is the problem, fixing it becomes more valuable
