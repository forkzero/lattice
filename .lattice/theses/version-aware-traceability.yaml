title: "Traceability Must Be Version-Aware to Enable Drift Detection"
body: |
  Traditional traceability links are static: "Implementation X traces to
  Requirement Y." But both X and Y change over time. Without version
  awareness, you can't answer:

  - "Was this implementation verified against the current requirement version?"
  - "When this requirement changed, what implementations need re-verification?"
  - "What was the requirement when this implementation was built?"

  Version-aware traceability binds edges to specific versions:
  - Implementation X v1.2 SATISFIES Requirement Y v1.0
  - When Y changes to v1.1, the edge is flagged as "potentially stale"
  - Drift detection becomes automatic, not manual

  This is the key to preventing requirements drift: not by preventing
  change, but by detecting when changes create inconsistencies.
