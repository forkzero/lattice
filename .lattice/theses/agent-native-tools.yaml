title: Agent-Native Tools Require Structured, Queryable Knowledge
body: |
  AI agents are fundamentally different consumers of information than humans:

  Humans can:
  - Skim documents and extract relevant information
  - Infer implicit relationships from context
  - Tolerate ambiguity and ask clarifying questions in real-time
  - Build mental models from unstructured narrative

  Agents need:
  - Explicit structure (can't reliably parse free-form prose)
  - Typed relationships (can't infer "this depends on that")
  - Atomic units (can't effectively use 50-page PRDs)
  - Query interfaces (need to ask "what requirements are uncovered?")

  Current tools (Jira, Notion, Confluence) optimize for human consumption.
  Agent-native tools must optimize for machine consumption while remaining
  human-readable.

  This is not a minor adaptation—it requires rethinking the fundamental
  data model, not just adding an API to existing tools.
