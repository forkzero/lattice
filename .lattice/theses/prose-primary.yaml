title: "Prose is Primary; Structure is Augmentation"
body: |
  Formal specification languages (Z, TLA+, Alloy) have never achieved
  mainstream adoption despite decades of research. The reason: formalizing
  intent is often as hard as implementing it.

  Natural language captures:
  - Context and rationale
  - Nuance and edge cases
  - Negotiable intent ("ideally X, but Y is acceptable")
  - Domain-specific terminology

  The mistake of many tools is requiring full formalization. This creates:
  - High barrier to entry
  - Loss of context and nuance
  - Specifications that are harder to read than code

  Better approach: Prose is primary, structure is augmentation.
  - Every node has a human-readable title and body
  - Structured metadata (edges, versions, tests) augments prose
  - You can always understand a requirement by reading it
  - Structure enables machine processing without replacing human expression

  Lattice should feel like writing documentation, with structure added
  incrementally, not like filling out forms.
