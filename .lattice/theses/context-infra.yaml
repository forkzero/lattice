title: Context Engineering Requires Structured Knowledge Infrastructure
body: 'The industry frames context engineering as a runtime problem — how to fill context windows with the right tokens. But effective context engineering depends on an upstream knowledge layer that is structured, version-aware, and traceable. Without it, agents retrieve from unstructured, unversioned, untraceable information. RAG answers ''what is similar?'' but cannot answer ''what is the chain of reasoning from research to code, and is it still valid?'' Lattice provides this infrastructure: typed nodes, version-bound edges, drift detection, and graph traversal ensure that downstream context selection is reliable. The knowledge graph is complementary to runtime context tools (LangChain, MCP, vector stores) — it is the coordination layer underneath.'
