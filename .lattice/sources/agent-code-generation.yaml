title: "AI Agents Capable of Autonomous Code Generation"
body: |
  Multiple studies and industry reports demonstrate that AI agents (Claude, GPT-4,
  Codex successors) can generate functional code from natural language specifications.
  However, quality depends heavily on specification clarity.

  Key findings:
  - Agents perform better with structured, atomic requirements
  - Ambiguous specifications lead to hallucinated requirements
  - Agents struggle to infer implicit dependencies
  - Iterative refinement improves output quality
