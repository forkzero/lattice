title: "Requirements Documentation Drifts From Implementation"
body: |
  Studies consistently show that requirements documentation becomes stale
  over time. Code evolves faster than documentation is updated, leading to
  a growing gap between what the documentation says and what the code does.

  Key findings:
  - 60-80% of requirements documents are out of date within 6 months
  - Developers stop trusting documentation, rely on code reading
  - Compliance audits fail due to documentation drift
  - The cost of re-synchronizing documentation exceeds original authoring cost

  Root causes:
  - No enforcement mechanism (docs and code can diverge freely)
  - Update friction (changing docs requires separate workflow)
  - No visibility (no alerts when drift occurs)
  - Wrong incentives (shipping code is rewarded, updating docs is not)

  Automated drift detection could address this by alerting when artifacts diverge.
