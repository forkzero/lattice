title: "Requirements Traceability Reduces Defects and Rework"
body: |
  Decades of software engineering research shows that requirements traceability—
  the ability to trace requirements through design, implementation, and testing—
  significantly reduces defects and rework costs.

  Key findings:
  - Projects with strong traceability have 30-50% fewer defects (Gotel & Finkelstein)
  - Lack of traceability is a top cause of project failure (Standish Group)
  - Manual traceability is expensive and degrades over time
  - Automated traceability tools improve consistency but require structured input

  However, most traceability tools assume human authors and readers. They don't
  support agent-mediated workflows where machines need to query and update
  traceability information programmatically.
