title: "Knowledge Graphs Enable Complex Relationship Queries"
body: |
  Knowledge graphs—directed graphs where nodes represent entities and edges
  represent relationships—have proven effective for representing complex,
  interconnected knowledge domains.

  Key findings:
  - Graph databases outperform relational for relationship-heavy queries
  - Explicit relationship typing improves query precision
  - Version-aware graphs enable temporal queries ("what was true at time T")
  - Graph traversal enables impact analysis ("what depends on X")

  Applications in requirements engineering:
  - Dependency graphs for change impact analysis
  - Traceability graphs for compliance
  - Concept graphs for domain modeling
