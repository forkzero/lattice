title: "Current Requirements Tools Optimized for Human Workflows"
body: |
  Existing requirements management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, IBM DOORS,
  Notion, Confluence) were designed for human authors and readers. They
  optimize for:

  - Rich text editing and formatting
  - Collaborative editing with comments
  - Flexible schemas and custom fields
  - Search and filtering
  - Integration with project management workflows

  What they lack for agent workflows:
  - Machine-parseable structure (most use rich text/HTML)
  - Explicit, typed relationships (links are untyped or weakly typed)
  - Version-aware edges (no "this link was valid for version X")
  - Programmatic write access (APIs exist but are secondary)
  - Drift detection (no alerts when linked artifacts change)
  - Feedback mechanisms (no way to record "implementation revealed gap")

  As agents become primary consumers of requirements, tools must evolve.
