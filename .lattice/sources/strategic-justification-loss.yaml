title: "Strategic Justification for Technical Decisions is Often Lost"
body: |
  Technical decisions in software projects are typically justified by strategic
  rationale: market conditions, competitive analysis, research findings, risk
  assessments. However, this justification is often:

  - Captured in ephemeral media (meetings, Slack, email)
  - Stored separately from technical artifacts (strategy decks vs. code)
  - Not explicitly linked to the decisions it justifies
  - Lost when team members leave

  Consequences:
  - New team members don't understand why decisions were made
  - Changing requirements requires rediscovering original rationale
  - "Chesterton's fence" problem: removing things without understanding why they exist
  - Compliance audits can't demonstrate decision rationale

  Explicit links from implementation → requirements → strategy → research
  would preserve this justification chain.
