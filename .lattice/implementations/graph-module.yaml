title: Graph Traversal and Drift Detection (graph.rs)
body: >
  Graph operations over the lattice: version drift detection via edge version
  comparison, dependency traversal with cycle detection, topological sort
  using Kahn's algorithm, and plan generation that categorizes requirements
  into verified/ready/blocked.

      rationale: find_drift detects stale version-bound edges

      version: 1.0.0
      rationale: Drift detection exposed via CLI drift command
