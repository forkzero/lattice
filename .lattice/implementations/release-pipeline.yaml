  GitHub Actions release workflow builds binaries for 4 targets
  (aarch64-apple-darwin, x86_64-apple-darwin, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,
  aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu). Packages as tar.gz with SHA256 checksums.
  Triggered by semantic version tags. Includes install.sh for curl-based
  installation, platform instructions in README, self-update command
  (lattice update), and passive update notification on launch with
  24-hour cached version check.
